### Stick Problem
#### Question: 
You have a stick of arbitrary length. You break the stick uniformly at random along itâ€™s length at two places, leaving you with three distinct pieces. What is the probability that you can form a triangle with the resulting three pieces?

#### Solution:


To bound the problem, let's our length of the stick has some unit length 1. Now breaking the stick uninformly at random along it's length at 2 places leaves us with 3 pieces. Because we have unit length of 1, only 2 variables x and y are fully specifying the lenghts of the deduced pieces. 1st piece of length x and second piece of length y and the third piece of length 1-x-y

##### Condition 1: <br>
    x < y + (1-x-y)
    x < 1 - x 
    2x < 1 
    x < 1/2 

##### Condition 2: <br>
    y < x + (1 - x - y) 
    y < 1 - y 
    2y < 1 
    y < 1/2
    
##### Condition 3: <br>
    (1-x-y) < x + y 
    2y < -2x + 1 
    y > -x + 1/2

im = plt.imread('space.png')
# show the image
plt.imshow(im)
plt.show()

The figure above clearly shows that the boundary conditions specify 1/4 of the total probability space.

Simulating this problem computationally in python to confirm our analytical solution:


```python

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
## number of iterations 
iterations = 10000
results = pd.DataFrame()
results['iteration'] = list(range(1,iterations+1))
percentage = iterations*[None]
np.random.seed(10815657)
count = 0
for i in range(0, iterations):
    random_draws = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=1, size=2)
    x = min(random_draws)
    y = abs(random_draws[0] - random_draws[1])
    if((x<0.5) and (y<0.5) and (0.5 < x+y)):
        count=count+1
    percentage[i] = count / (i+1)
results['percentage'] = percentage
plt.plot(results['iteration'], results['percentage'], color='red')
plt.xlabel('Number of trials') 
plt.ylabel('Percentage of simulations where pieces can form a triangle')
print(percentage[iterations-1])
plt
```

As shown above, over 10,000 simulations the results converge to probability 1/4 (i.e. 25%) that the three broken pieces can form a triangle
